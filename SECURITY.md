## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security bugs in this project seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of our project. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS HERE]
OR by opening an issue with the `security` label if your GitHub repository
supports private vulnerability reporting. We will assess each report and work on a fix.

Please include the following information with your report:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The version of the affected software.
- Any PoC (Proof of Concept) code, if available.
- Your name and a link to your profile (e.g., GitHub, LinkedIn) for acknowledgement (optional).

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and we will send a more
detailed response within 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling
your report.

We kindly ask you not to disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have
had a chance to address it.
